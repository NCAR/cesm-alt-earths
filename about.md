## About

This group was created after the closing discussion at the Alternative Earths session during the [2021 CESM Workshop](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/workshops/2021/). You can view the live replay on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-szhDkf5DYI]

This group welcomes presentations highlighting the application of CESM to simulate “alternative Earths”, encompassing both early Earth, planets and moons of our solar system, and exoplanet studies. Topics suitable for this group include studies of the climate and chemistry of early Earth, the circulation of slowly rotating and tidally locked planets, and the chemical and dynamical impacts of changing the spectral type of host star. Also of interest are presentations on introducing greater flexibility in model components to simulate alternative land and ocean distributions, radically different atmospheric composition and orbital characteristics / calendars, as well as comparisons of CESM to other planetary models.
